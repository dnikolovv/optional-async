# Optional.Async [DEPRECATED]

Use Optional 5.0 instead. It now includes its own async extensions.

---

Async extensions for Nils Luck's Optional library.

It allows you to chain `Task<Option<T>>` and `Task<Option<T, TException>>` without having to use `await`.

See any service in [DevAdventures RealWorld project](https://github.com/dnikolovv/dev-adventures-realworld) for examples.

# How to install
It's available as a NuGet package under `Optional.Async`.
